• Implement notifications for users when a door's status changes (i.e., correctly open/closed)

## PC - back-end
• User creation/edit/delete (id, password, permitted areas –doors–) 
• Introduce doors names/codes, assign access permissions, and set operating hours. 
• Lock/unlock all doors (admin)	

## Both

• Allow users to view access history for each registered door. 2. [bonus] Security Measures: 
• Implement encryption for data transmission to protect user and door information. 
• Conduct a security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities

## Technologies and Tools

• Programming Language: Choose a language such as Python, Java, or JavaScript, Dart (flutter), etc based on team expertise and project requirements. 
• Database: Utilize any type of database (e.g., JSON, MySQL, PostgreSQL, …) for user and door configuration storage. 
• Framework: Select an appropriate web or mobile framework for building the app's frontend and backend components. 
• Version Control: Use a version control system (e.g., Git) for collaborative development.
